# Slime Soccer
2D football-style physics game featuring 4 player local / network multiplayer. Heavily based on Quin Pendragon's World Cup Soccer Slime.

N.B: This old project is one of my first developments (completed in 2015) and as such is very novice in its code style; it exists more for archival purposes than anything else.
